  ‚óè	Integrated PCB designs with firmware requirements.
  

## üõ† Additional Projects

  ‚óè	Nairobi High Powered LED Lights (250-500 Watt)
    This was a risky and innovative job. I innovated technology not previously used in the field of lighting to control voltage ripple for use with Infrared, UV-A, B, and C, Color Temps, and RGB. I also designed light cards and used the concept of prioritizing the use of Voltage over Current to deliver power and keep the system temperature down.
    
  ‚óè	Drone Release System
    A risky project where safety was paramount. Zero mistakes could be made and we were successful. Most of the project is hidden via NDA.
    
  ‚óè	8x8 LED Matrix Display
    A massive modular led sign was designed for use in businesses. It included an encoder that kids could use to draw designs while their teeth were worked on for a dentistry business or could display intricate light shows.
    
  ‚óè	Litesys LED Construction Sign
    Modular LED Construction signs used for traffic control and monitoring. Displayed speeds, messages, and warnings. Often mounted on DoT trucks. Had to pass rigorous regulatory measures to sell to states.
